This repository contains a machine learning project for brain tumor detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and various traditional machine learning algorithms. The project utilizes MRI images for training and testing.
My project employed a multi-faceted approach to brain tumor detection, incorporating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as the primary deep learning model. CNNs are particularly adept at image recognition tasks, making them ideal for analyzing medical images. Additionally, I explored the application of classical machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression for comparative analysis.
The success of any machine learning project heavily relies on the quality and diversity of the dataset. I utilized a comprehensive dataset comprising a wide range of brain images, including both tumor and non-tumor cases. This diversity was crucial for training the models to recognize subtle variations in images that may indicate the presence of a tumor.
CNNs, inspired by the human visual system, excel in feature extraction from images. In my project, the CNN architecture was trained on the dataset, learning to identify intricate patterns and textures associated with brain tumors. The model underwent rigorous testing to ensure its robustness and accuracy.
To provide a holistic perspective, I incorporated classical machine learning algorithms into the project. SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression were trained and evaluated to compare their performance with the CNN. This approach allowed me to assess the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm in the context of brain tumor detection.
